# Token Efficiency Mode

Every tool call costs tokens. Every token costs money. Operate with the minimum tool calls needed for the same quality result.

## Before Calling Any Tool

Ask yourself these three questions:

1. **Is this information already in the conversation?** Check IDE selection, prior tool results, CLAUDE.md, rules, and recent messages before reaching for a tool.
2. **Am I using the cheapest tool for this job?** Grep is cheaper than Read. Read with offset/limit is cheaper than full Read. Dedicated tools are cheaper than Bash.
3. **Can I combine this with another call?** Parallel independent calls in one message. Combine grep patterns with `|` instead of multiple searches.

If the answer to #1 is yes, skip the tool call entirely.

## Tool Call Rules

### Read
- Never read a full file to find one value. Use Grep instead.
- Never re-read a file you just edited. Edit/Write confirms success.
- Never re-read a file already in conversation context.
- When you must read, use offset/limit to target the specific section.
- Never read a file the user already pasted or selected in the IDE.

### Grep / Glob
- Go directly to named files. If the user said "check app.dart", do not Glob for it.
- Combine related patterns: `pattern1|pattern2|pattern3` in one Grep call.
- Use `output_mode: "content"` with tight `-A`/`-B` context instead of reading matched files separately.
- Use `head_limit` to cap results when you only need the first few matches.

### Bash
- Never use Bash for grep, find, cat, head, tail, sed, awk, or echo. Use dedicated tools.
- Reserve Bash for commands that have no dedicated tool equivalent (build, test, git, curl).

### Agent
- Never spawn an Agent for a single-file task. Use Grep/Read directly.
- Never spawn an Agent to do something you can do in one tool call.
- Use Agent only when the task genuinely requires multi-step exploration across many files.

### Figma MCP
- Never use `get_design_context` for UI checks. It costs 50-150K tokens.
- Use `get_metadata` (~3-8K tokens) for measurements and hierarchy.
- Use `get_screenshot` (~2-4K tokens) for visual reference.
- Only use `get_design_context` when Code Connect mappings are explicitly needed.

## Output Rules

- Lead with the answer. Skip preamble, transitions, and restatements.
- Use tables for structured comparisons. Use code blocks for code. Use bullet points for lists.
- Do not summarize what you just did unless the user asks.
- Do not explain your reasoning unless the user asks.
- Do not list things that are correct. Only report what needs attention.
- One-sentence answers are fine when one sentence is sufficient.

## Parallel Execution

- Always batch independent tool calls into a single message.
- If you need to read 3 unrelated files, send all 3 Read calls at once.
- If you need to Grep for 3 different patterns in different directories, send all 3 at once.
- Never chain independent calls sequentially.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not explore "just in case". Search with intent.
- Do not read context files (me.md, work.md, team.md) unless the task requires that context.
- Do not read SKILL.md files for skills that are not relevant to the current task.
- Do not add error handling, comments, or types to code you did not change.
- Do not propose improvements beyond what was asked.
- Do not create files that are not strictly necessary.
