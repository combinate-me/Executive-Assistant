## Daily Tools

These integrations are used every day and should be loaded proactively when relevant:

- **Teamwork** - Read tasks, read comments, create tasks. Skill: `/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/combinate/teamwork/SKILL.md`. Trigger on any mention of tasks, projects, deadlines, assignments, or Teamwork. API key in `.env`.
- **Insites** - Platform entry point. Skill: `/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/insites/SKILL.md`. Routes to module sub-skills. API key in `.env`.
- **CRM** - Contacts, companies, log email activities. Skill: `/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/insites/crm/SKILL.md`. Trigger on any CRM lookup, contact search, or email logging.
- **Combinate** - Client context, Google Drive folders, cross-system lookups. Skill: `/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/combinate/SKILL.md`. Trigger when a client or project is mentioned and context needs to be gathered.

## Skills

Skills live in `.claude/skills/`. Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file that defines a repeatable workflow.

**Pattern:** `.claude/skills/skill-name/SKILL.md`

Skills are built organically. When you notice a recurring request, suggest turning it into a skill.

**Important:** New skills must always be created in the Combinate Assistant directory, regardless of which project is currently active:
`/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/combinate/skill-name/SKILL.md`

Never create skill files inside a client project repo.

### Skills to Build (Backlog)

These workflows came up during onboarding as candidates for future skills:

1. **Proposal writing** - Templated proposal generation for new leads
2. **Monthly management reports** - Generate recurring management/performance reports
3. **Client user manuals** - Generate user documentation from a project's codebase
4. **Six-monthly client check-ins** - Templated outreach for relationship maintenance
5. **Prospect follow-up sequences** - Drafting and tracking follow-up communications with leads
6. **AI adoption tracking** - Frameworks for measuring and reporting on team AI tool usage and output

## Client Context

When a client or project is mentioned, proactively gather full context before responding. Use the **combinate** skill (`/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/combinate/SKILL.md`) which covers the full workflow for multi-source context gathering.

The common identifier across all sources is the **company name and TLA** (three-letter abbreviation, e.g., IEC for International Eucharistic Congress).

Pull context from these sources in parallel:

1. **Google Calendar** - Search for meetings with the client name. Check for recent meeting recordings and notes.
2. **Google Drive** - Look up the client's folder via the `google_drive_url` custom field in the Insites CRM.
3. **Insites CRM** - Look up the company record for contacts, notes, and activity history. Skill: `/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/insites/crm/SKILL.md`.
4. **Slack** - Search for the client name or TLA across channels for internal conversations.
5. **Teamwork** - Find the relevant project and open tasks. Skill: `/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/combinate/teamwork/SKILL.md`.
6. **Gmail** - Search for emails to/from the client domain or by company name.

**Finding a client's Drive folder:** Combinate company records have two custom fields:
- `client_tla` - the three-letter abbreviation (e.g. "MIG", "IEC")
- `google_drive_url` - direct link to the client's Google Drive folder

See `/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/combinate/SKILL.md` for the full lookup workflow. If either field is missing, flag it to Shane.

Do not ask Shane to provide context that can be gathered from these sources directly. Pull first, ask only if something is genuinely missing or ambiguous.

## Client Task Workflow

Every piece of client work must be anchored to a Teamwork task. Before starting any client task:

1. **Confirm there is a Teamwork task.** If Shane has not provided a task link or ID, ask: "Do you have a Teamwork task for this, or would you like me to create one?"
2. **Work inside the task.** Use the task ID to name the Drive subfolder and reference it in all related documents.
3. **Leave a comment on the Teamwork task** when the work is done (or at key milestones). The comment should summarise what was completed and link to any documents or drafts created. This keeps the team informed and creates a clear audit trail for Erin and others collaborating on the project.

Example comment format:
> Follow-up analysis completed. Documents created in client Drive folder:
> - [TCO Analysis Spreadsheet](link)
> - [Follow-Up Summary Doc](link)
>
> Email draft ready in Gmail for Shane to review and send.

## Document Standards

All Google Docs created for client work must use the **Combinate branded template** unless Shane explicitly says otherwise.

- **Template ID:** `12TovrIc6MuTjl0dvRycqR56HWssYISNvdnrI_4CwW8U`
- Use `createDocumentFromTemplate` - never `createDocument` for client-facing docs
- Replace `"Document Title"` and `"Document Subtitle"` placeholders in the cover
- See `/Users/combinate-maiks/Combinate-Assistant/.claude/skills/combinate/post-meeting-followup/SKILL.md` for the full document creation workflow including how to clear sample content and apply heading styles

Google Sheets do not have a branded template - use `createSpreadsheet` as normal.

## Google Drive File Structure

When creating documents or spreadsheets for a client task:

- Navigate to the client's Google Drive folder
- Open the `Tasks` subfolder
- Create a new subfolder named: `[TEAMWORK_TASK_ID] - [Short Description]`
  - Example: `25429514 - IEC Website Language Translation`
- Save all related files (analysis docs, spreadsheets, briefs) inside that subfolder

This keeps task-related files organised and linked back to the Teamwork task ID.

## Email Standards

All emails drafted for Shane must be:

- **Format:** HTML (`text/html` content type) - never plain text
- **Styling:** Use bold for emphasis, bullet points for lists, clear paragraph breaks
- **Signature:** Always append Shane's HTML signature to every email draft. The signature HTML is stored in `branding/email-signature.html` - read that file and append it to the end of the email body. Gmail does NOT automatically apply signatures to API-created drafts.

When creating a draft reply, thread it into the existing email thread where one exists.

## Decision Log

All meaningful decisions are logged in `decisions/log.md`.

- Append-only. Never edit or delete past entries.
- Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD] DECISION: ... | REASONING: ... | CONTEXT: ...`
- When a significant decision is made during a session, log it.

## Memory

Claude Code maintains a persistent memory across conversations. As you work with your assistant, it automatically saves important patterns, preferences, and learnings. You don't need to configure this. It works out of the box.

If you want your assistant to remember something specific, just say "remember that I always want X" and it will save it.

Memory + context files + decision log = your assistant gets smarter over time without you re-explaining things.

## Keeping Context Current

- Update `context/current-priorities.md` when your focus shifts
- Update `context/goals.md` at the start of each quarter
- Log important decisions in `decisions/log.md`
- Add reference files to `references/` as needed
- Build skills in `.claude/skills/` when you notice recurring requests

## Projects

Active workstreams live in `projects/`. Each project gets a folder with a `README.md` describing the project, its status, and key dates.

## Templates

Reusable templates live in `templates/`.

- `templates/session-summary.md` - Session closeout template

## Branding

Brand assets and guidelines live in `branding/`.

- `branding/README.md` - Index of brand assets and links to source files
- `branding/brand-guidelines.md` - Brand rules summary (colors, typography, tone)
- `branding/assets/` - Exported logos, icons, and other brand files

When generating client-facing content, proposals, or any external communications, refer to `branding/` for visual and tone consistency.

## References

Reference material lives in `references/`.

- `references/sops/` - Standard operating procedures
- `references/examples/` - Example outputs and style guides

## Archives

When something is no longer active, move it to `archives/`. Never delete. Always archive.
