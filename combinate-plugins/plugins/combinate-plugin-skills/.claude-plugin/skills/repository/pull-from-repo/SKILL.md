# Skill: Pull From Repository

## Overview

Fetch and merge the latest changes from the remote GitHub repository into the current local branch, then notify the user that the codebase is up to date.

## When to Use

- "Pull latest changes" / "pull latest skills" / "sync with GitHub"
- "Pull latest changes from GitHub" / "pull latest skills from GitHub"
- Any request to sync the local codebase with the remote master branch

## Auth

`TEAMWORK_API_KEY`, `TEAMWORK_SITE`, `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` from `.env`.

---

## Step 1 — Check for uncommitted local changes

Run:

```
git status
```

If there are uncommitted changes, stop and ask the user: **"You have uncommitted local changes. Would you like to stash them before pulling, or cancel?"**

- If stash: run `git stash`, then continue to Step 2
- If cancel: stop

---

## Step 2 — Fetch latest from remote

Run:

```
git fetch origin
```

This downloads all remote changes without modifying the local branch.

---

## Step 3 — Merge latest master into current branch

Run:

```
git merge origin/master
```

If the result is **"Already up to date"**, skip to Step 5 and notify the user accordingly.

If there are **merge conflicts**, list the conflicting files and stop. Ask the user how to resolve. Do not auto-resolve.

---

## Step 4 — Restore stashed changes (if applicable)

If the user chose to stash in Step 1, run:

```
git stash pop
```

This restores their local changes on top of the freshly pulled code. If the stash pop results in **conflicts**, list the conflicting files and stop. Ask the user how to resolve. Do not auto-resolve.

If no stash was made in Step 1, skip this step.

---

## Step 5 — Confirm what was pulled

Run:

```
git log --oneline -5
```

Also run:

```
git config user.name
```

Note the current branch, the most recent commits, and the git user name. This will be included in the Slack notification.

---

## Step 6 — Send Slack notification

Always post to the `#executive-assistant` channel (`C0ARB20T3DM`) using `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` from `.env` via `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`.

**On success**, post:

```
<@UE0U3PBGT> *Pull from repository completed*

*Pulled by:* GIT_USER_NAME
*Branch:* `BRANCH_NAME`
*Latest commits:*
COMMIT_LOG (from git log --oneline -5)
```

**On failure** (merge conflicts, fetch error, or non-zero exit code), post:

```
<@UE0U3PBGT> *Pull from repository failed*

*Pulled by:* GIT_USER_NAME
*Branch:* `BRANCH_NAME`
*Error:* ERROR_DETAILS
```

## Notes

- Never use `--force` or destructive flags
- Never discard local changes without explicit confirmation from the user
- Working directory: `/Users/cmb-jim/CMB Projects/Combinate-Assistant`
- Remote: `origin` → `combinate-me/Executive-Assistant`
