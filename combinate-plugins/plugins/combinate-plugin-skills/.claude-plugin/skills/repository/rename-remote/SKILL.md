# Skill: Rename Remote

## Overview

Update the local git remote to point to a renamed GitHub repository. Stashes any local changes first, updates the remote URL, pulls the latest from the new remote, and restores local changes.

## When to Use

- "The repository was renamed" / "repo was renamed" / "remote repo was renamed"
- "Update the remote URL" / "the GitHub repo has a new name" / "update remote after rename"
- Any request to update the local git remote URL after a repository rename on GitHub

## Known Rename

This skill is pre-configured for the following rename:

| | URL |
|---|---|
| **Old** | `git@github.com:combinate-me/Executive-Assistant.git` |
| **New** | `git@github.com:combinate-me/Executive-Assistant.git` |

If the current remote matches the old URL, the update is applied automatically with no prompts.

## Auth

`SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` from `.env`.

---

## Step 0 — Ask for the user's name

Before doing anything else, ask:

**"What is your name?"**

Save the response as `USER_NAME`. This will be included in the Slack notification so the team knows who ran the update.

---

## Step 1 — Check the current remote URL

Run:

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Save the output as `CURRENT_REMOTE_URL`.

- If `CURRENT_REMOTE_URL` is `git@github.com:combinate-me/Executive-Assistant.git`:
  - Set `NEW_REMOTE_URL` = `git@github.com:combinate-me/Executive-Assistant.git`
  - Tell the user: "Detected the old remote. Updating to the new repository automatically."
  - Proceed to Step 2.

- If `CURRENT_REMOTE_URL` is already `git@github.com:combinate-me/Executive-Assistant.git`:
  - Tell the user: "Your remote is already pointing to the new repository. Nothing to update."
  - Stop.

- If `CURRENT_REMOTE_URL` is something else:
  - Ask: **"The current remote is `CURRENT_REMOTE_URL`. What should it be updated to?"**
  - Save the response as `NEW_REMOTE_URL` and proceed to Step 2.

---

## Step 2 — Stash all local changes

Always run this, regardless of whether there appear to be local changes:

```bash
git stash push --include-untracked -m "local changes before remote rename"
```

- `--include-untracked` ensures new files that have not yet been staged are also saved
- If the output is `No local changes to save`, note this and continue — the stash was a no-op
- If the stash succeeds, note that a stash was created so it can be restored in Step 6

Do not skip this step. Running it when there is nothing to stash is harmless and prevents any risk of overwriting work.

---

## Step 3 — Update the remote URL

Run:

```bash
git remote set-url origin NEW_REMOTE_URL
```

Then verify the change:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Confirm the new URL is shown correctly. If not, stop and tell the user: "The remote URL could not be updated. Check that the URL is valid and try again."

---

## Step 4 — Fetch from the new remote

Run:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

If this fails with an authentication error or "repository not found", stop and tell the user:

> "Could not connect to the new remote. Please check:
> - The URL is correct
> - You have access to the repository
> - Your credentials are up to date"

---

## Step 5 — Merge the latest changes

Run:

```bash
git merge origin/master
```

If the result is **"Already up to date"**, note this and continue.

If there are **merge conflicts**, list the conflicting files and stop. Ask the user how to resolve them. Do not auto-resolve.

---

## Step 6 — Restore stashed changes (if applicable)

If a stash was created in Step 2 (i.e. the stash output was not `No local changes to save`), run:

```bash
git stash pop
```

This restores local changes on top of the updated codebase.

If the stash pop results in **conflicts**, list the conflicting files and stop. Ask the user how to resolve them. Do not auto-resolve.

If no stash was made, skip this step.

---

## Step 7 — Confirm what was pulled

Run:

```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

Also run:

```bash
git config user.name
```

Note the current branch, the most recent commits, and the git user name. This will be included in the Slack notification.

---

## Step 8 — Send Slack notification

Always post to the `#executive-assistant` channel (`C0ARB20T3DM`) using `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` from `.env` via `https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage`.

**On success**, post:

```
<@UE0U3PBGT> *Remote repository renamed and synced*

*Updated by:* USER_NAME
*Branch:* `BRANCH_NAME`
*Old remote:* CURRENT_REMOTE_URL
*New remote:* NEW_REMOTE_URL
*Latest commits:*
COMMIT_LOG (from git log --oneline -5)
```

**On failure** (fetch error, merge conflict, or non-zero exit code), post:

```
<@UE0U3PBGT> *Remote rename failed*

*Updated by:* USER_NAME
*Branch:* `BRANCH_NAME`
*Attempted URL:* NEW_REMOTE_URL
*Error:* ERROR_DETAILS
```

---

## Step 9 — Confirm to the user

Respond with:

> Remote updated successfully.
>
> - Old remote: `CURRENT_REMOTE_URL`
> - New remote: `NEW_REMOTE_URL`
> - Latest changes pulled from the new remote
> - Your local changes have been restored (if any were stashed)
> - Notification posted to #executive-assistant

---

## Error Handling

- **Remote already up to date** — Tell the user and stop. Nothing to do.
- **Fetch fails (auth error)** — Stop and tell the user to check their credentials or access rights.
- **Merge conflicts** — List the conflicting files and stop. Never auto-resolve.
- **Stash pop conflicts** — List the conflicting files and stop. Tell the user to resolve them manually.
- **Slack error** — Complete the git steps anyway and tell the user: "Remote updated but Slack notification failed — please notify Jim manually."

## Notes

- Never use `--force` or any destructive git flags
- Never discard local changes — always stash and pop
- Python on this machine is invoked as `python` (not `python3`)
- Working directory: `/Users/cmb-jim/CMB Projects/Combinate-Assistant`
- Remote: `origin`
