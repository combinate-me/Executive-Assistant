# Insites: CMS Developer Skill

This skill covers building web applications and content-driven pages on the Insites platform. Read the relevant reference doc for the specific domain you are working in.

---

## Architecture Overview

Insites applications follow a strict separation of concerns:

| Layer | Location | Responsibility |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Pages | `app/views/pages/` | Request handling, GraphQL calls, data passing to partials |
| Partials | `app/views/partials/` | All HTML rendering, reusable UI components, business logic functions |
| Layouts | `app/views/layouts/` | Outer HTML shell (head, nav, footer) shared across pages |
| GraphQL | `app/graphql/` | All data access operations (queries and mutations) |
| Assets | `app/assets/` | Static files (CSS, JS, images, fonts) served via CDN |

---

## Core Rules

**Non-negotiable architectural constraints:**

1. **Pages are controllers** - No raw HTML in page files. Pages call GraphQL, pass data to partials.
2. **GraphQL is the only data layer** - All reads and writes go through GraphQL. No direct database access.
3. **Partials contain all HTML** - No HTML in pages. All presentation logic lives in partials.
4. **GraphQL calls belong in pages only** - Never call GraphQL from inside a partial.
5. **Variables in partials are local** - Variables defined in a page are not available in partials unless explicitly passed. Use `export` to surface values via `context.exports`.
6. **No hardcoded user-facing text** - Use the translation filter `{{ 'key' | t }}` for any text that may change.

---

## Forbidden Behaviors

- Editing files inside `./modules/` (read-only; customize via documented override mechanisms)
- Bypassing CSRF or authorization protections
- Accessing data outside of GraphQL operations
- Hardcoding credentials, API keys, or user-facing text directly in templates
- Writing GraphQL calls inside partials
- Using `context.current_user` directly (use the provided user module helpers instead)

---

## Decision Tree: Common Tasks

**Building a new page:**
1. Create the page file in `app/views/pages/`
2. Write the GraphQL query in `app/graphql/`
3. Call the query from the page using `{% graphql %}`
4. Pass results to a partial using `render`
5. Build the HTML in the partial

**Displaying data:**
1. Write a GraphQL query for the data
2. Call it in the page
3. Render a partial, passing the query result as a variable

**Creating a reusable component:**
1. Create a partial in `app/views/partials/`
2. Use `render` to include it with `{% render 'path/to/partial', var: value %}`
3. Keep all HTML inside the partial

**Adding a background operation:**
1. Use `{% background %}` tag in a page for async work
2. Pass required variables explicitly (background jobs have limited scope access)

**Serving a static file:**
1. Place the file in `app/assets/`
2. Reference it using `{{ 'filename.ext' | asset_url }}` in templates
