# Skill: Insites

Insites is a platform for building web applications with integrated business tools. This skill is the entry point. When a specific module is involved, read the relevant sub-skill listed below.

---

## Setup: Environment Variables

All three variables must be set in `.env` before using any Insites skill:

```
INSITES_INSTANCE_URL=https://your-instance.insites.io
INSITES_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
INSITES_CRM_ADMIN_UUID=your_crm_admin_uuid_here
```

| Variable | Purpose | Where to find it |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `INSITES_INSTANCE_URL` | Your Insites instance URL | The domain you use to access your instance |
| `INSITES_API_KEY` | API authentication key | Admin > Integrations > Instance API Key |
| `INSITES_CRM_ADMIN_UUID` | Your admin UUID in the CRM - used when logging activities on your behalf | Admin > Profile > UUID |

**Note:** Regenerating your API key invalidates the previous one. The `.env` file must not be committed to version control.

---

## Base Request Pattern

All API requests use the `Authorization` header with the API key directly (not Basic Auth):

```bash
source .env && curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: $INSITES_API_KEY" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  "$INSITES_INSTANCE_URL/[module]/api/v2/[endpoint]"
```

**Rate limit:** 300 requests per 60 seconds.

## Module Sub-Skills

Each Insites module has its own sub-skill. Load the relevant one when working with a specific module:

| Module | Sub-skill | What it covers |
